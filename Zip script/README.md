## Script for convenient ziping

The script is pretty simple and allows you select projects folder and zip files without monotonous selection.
How to:
1. Choose directory with projects (not the exact project folder, but directory with all projects);
2. Select zip option and type number of project
3. You can apply command-line flag to search for .hdl in all subdirectories

Currently only .hdl is available, but you can edit the script.
