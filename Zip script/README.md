# Project Zipping Utility Documentation

This script is designed to process of zipping files within project directories, eliminating repetitive manual selection. It focuses on `.hdl` files.

## How to

1. Select directory containing all you projects (not exact project, only folder  containing them). 

2. Select zip option and type number of project.

3. You can apply command-line flag to search for .hdl in all subdirectories.

## Current Limitations

- **File Type Specificity**: The script currently processes only `.hdl` files. If there is a need to handle other types of files, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
